# Chess Engine in C

Welcome to **Chess Engine in C**! This project is a high-performance chess engine implemented in the C programming language. It is designed to provide a strong chess-playing experience with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Efficiently searches the game tree to make strong moves.
- **Evaluation Function**: Evaluates board positions based on various heuristics.
- **Opening Book**: Utilizes a pre-defined book of opening moves.
- **Endgame Tablebases**: (Optional) Provides optimal play in simplified endgames.
- **Multi-threading**: Supports parallel processing to speed up the search.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler**: GCC or Clang is recommended.
- **Make**: For building the project.

## Instalation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
